# ANPR

It's a really old project and today it comes into my mind that I should add a readme file to make it look prettier.

It's a project for image processing cource of Nanjing Univeristy and I think the ANPR should mean automobile number plate recognition.

The whole process includes a filter that seperates numbers and letters on the number plate and a recognizer that recognize the numbers and letters. For the recognition part I simply compare the segemented letter/number with provided letter/number template, and if the difference is below some threshold, they'll be regarded as same number/letter.

The accuracy is only 60% if my memory is correct. Back when I was doing the project I did not learn any artificial intelligence and machine learning stuff. The method above was the best method that I could think of at that time lul.
